        <p>My name is Luna De Luca, I am an photographer based in Munich. Working closely with my parents - my father is an established lifestyle and outdoor photographer and my mother is a stylist and set designer - I learned the fundamental skills working at film and photography sets.
My constant quest to tell outrageous stories of humans in new perspectives has led me not only to photograph, but also to develop creative concepts, stylings and magazine designs.
In 2020, I have published my first magazine documenting the living conditions of Nepalese children. Two years later I had my first exhibition with my photographs against the abuse of women. Shooting a lot on film has brought me to recently develope my own analogue films.
